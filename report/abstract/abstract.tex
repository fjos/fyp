\begin{abstract}

This project concerns the design and implementation of a distributed memory barrier for OpenCL, a framework for programming across heterogeneous platforms. This project emphasizes the implementation and testing of a novel solution for overcoming the challenges associated with designing a distributed memory barrier. After considering the ways a distributed memory barrier could be overcome, and the advantages and disadvantages of these implementations, one was chosen as the basis for a library implementing distributed OpenCL. The library uses C\texttt{++} 11 and OpenMPI (a message passing interface library) to allow shared memory across systems. By utilizing this library in various situations, the ease of distributing computation can be demonstrated, as well as the limitations of such an approach. Additionally, possible future additions and improvements are considered.
